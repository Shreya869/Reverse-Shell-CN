Another popular use of reverse shell though not very ethical, is for hackers who want to gain access to someones PC without his knowledge. What they do is that they spread this program around by giving free CD's or pen-drives in front of Walmart or something and you pop in the pen-drive thinking hey I wonder whats in this. And boom they now have access to your computer.
